# nerual-network_-Back-propagation
In this project, we will implement the Back propagation learning for a 2 layer perceptron. Moreover, we will discuss and experiment the aspects for influencing the training; and test the trained weights and “fault tolerance”.
Develop Tools: MATLAB R2018a.
Program running help: 
1.	For each part you can see the related program file name followed by each part’s title, then in the MATLAB under the files’ directory, type “help [file Name]” to get running help.
2.	Run the training, please load "mablab_7.3.mat" first to get all the initial and trained values.
